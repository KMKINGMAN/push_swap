# Push_Swap Project To-Do List

## 1. Understand the Project Requirements
- [x] Read through the project subject and guidelines thoroughly.
- [x] Understand the rules and constraints for the allowed operations (`sa`, `sb`, `ss`, `pa`, `pb`, `ra`, `rb`, `rr`, `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`).

## 2. Set Up the Development Environment
- [x] Create a new directory for the project.
- [ ] Set up version control with Git.
- [x] Create initial files: `Makefile`, `push_swap.c`, and header files.

## 3. Implement the Basic Operations
- [x] Implement the stack data structure.
- [x] Implement the allowed operations:
  - [x] `sa` (swap a)
  - [x] `sb` (swap b)
  - [x] `ss` (swap both a and b)
  - [x] `pa` (push a)
  - [x] `pb` (push b)
  - [x] `ra` (rotate a)
  - [x] `rb` (rotate b)
  - [x] `rr` (rotate both a and b)
  - [x] `rra` (reverse rotate a)
  - [x] `rrb` (reverse rotate b)
  - [x] `rrr` (reverse rotate both a and b)

## 4. Develop the Sorting Algorithm
- [ ] Research and decide on the sorting algorithm (e.g., insertion sort or quicksort).
- [ ] Implement the chosen sorting algorithm using the allowed operations.
- [ ] Optimize the algorithm to minimize the number of operations.

## 5. Handle Edge Cases and Error Management
- [ ] Implement input validation to handle incorrect inputs.
- [ ] Ensure the program handles edge cases (e.g., already sorted stack, duplicate numbers).

## 6. Test the Implementation
- [ ] Write test cases for each operation.
- [ ] Write test cases for the sorting algorithm with various input sizes and edge cases.
- [ ] Verify that the program meets the project's constraints and requirements.

## 7. Optimize and Refactor Code
- [ ] Review the code for optimization opportunities.
- [ ] Refactor the code for readability and maintainability.
- [ ] Ensure the code follows the 42 School's coding standards.

## 8. Documentation
- [ ] Write a README file with instructions on how to use the program.
- [ ] Comment the code to explain the logic and important sections.

## 9. Final Testing and Submission
- [ ] Perform final testing to ensure the program works as expected.
- [ ] Verify that the program meets all the project requirements.
- [ ] Submit the project according to the 42 School's submission guidelines.

## Additional Resources
- [ ] Review the 42 School's curriculum and resources for additional help.
- [ ] Consult with peers or mentors for feedback and advice.
