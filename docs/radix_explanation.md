# How Our Number Sorting Machine Works ðŸŽª

## The Magic Box Story ðŸ“¦

Imagine you have a bunch of numbered blocks, some with positive numbers (like +5) and some with negative numbers (like -3). We need to put them in order, from smallest to biggest!

### Step 1: Making All Numbers Friendly 
First, we do a magic trick! We find the smallest number in our pile and use it to make all numbers positive. It's like lifting everything up so there are no negative numbers anymore.

Example:
- If we have: [-3, 5, -7, 1]
- Smallest is -7
- We add 7 to each number: [4, 12, 0, 8]
- Now all numbers are positive! ðŸŽ‰

### Step 2: The Binary Dance ðŸ•ºðŸ’ƒ
We turn each number into binary (like a secret code of 1s and 0s). Then we look at each position, one at a time:

```
Original: 4 -> Binary: 100 Original: 12 -> Binary: 1100 Original: 0 -> Binary: 000 Original: 8 -> Binary: 1000
```

### Step 3: The Sorting Game ðŸŽ®
We play a game! For each position (starting from the right):
- If we see a 0, move the number to Stack B
- If we see a 1, keep it in Stack A and rotate
- When done with all numbers, move everything back to Stack A

It's like sorting blocks into two piles based on their secret code!

### Step 4: The Magic Reversal âœ¨
At the end, we remember to subtract the number we added at the start. This brings back our original numbers, but now they're in order!

## Why It Works? ðŸ¤”
- Binary numbers are like secret instructions
- By looking at one position at a time, we slowly put everything in order
- It's like sorting candy by color, but we do it with numbers!

## Fun Facts! ðŸŒŸ
- This method works really well with big numbers
- It's like playing with building blocks
- The computer can do this very fast!

Remember: Even though it seems complex, it's just moving blocks around based on simple rules, one step at a time! ðŸŽ¯
